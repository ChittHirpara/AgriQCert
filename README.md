## 🎯 The Problem

Agricultural exports face critical challenges:
- **7-10 day certification delays** causing missed trade windows
- **15-20% rejection rates** at international customs due to documentation issues
- **Rampant certificate fraud** with no verification mechanism
- **Manual verification process** preventing fast cross-border trade
- **Zero traceability** from farm to final destination

## ✅ The Solution

**AgriQCert** digitizes the entire agricultural certification ecosystem with a **secure, real-time platform** that connects exporters, QA agencies, and importers in minutes, not days. Using cryptographic signatures and QR codes, we eliminate fraud while enabling instant verification.

**Impact**: Reduces certification time from 7-10 days to 24-48 hours | Prevents 100% of certificate forgery | Enables instant global verification
